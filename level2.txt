1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.
When writing code, you should be clear and concise for example naming functions with a clear meaning. When you structure your code, you 
should leave comments for explanations on how the block of code works (especially if you are working on a team). 
You shuld always use indentation, so your code is readable. 

2. What is a Regular Expression?
RegEx are patterns that can be performed on strings. You can use this to validate 
emails for an example, or check if a string that is put in is just numbers or letters. 

3. What does the .random() method do?
the method is used to generate a random number between 0.0 and 1.0. 

4. What does the .sort() method do?
The sort method sorts the items of an array, by default it sorts in alphabetical and ascending order. 

5. What does the .reverse() method do?
The reverse method reverses the order of the elements in an array. 

6. List two examples of bad JavaScript code.
- Using non-strict comparison operators, and then comparing across different types:
ex. 
1 == “1”; // true
false == “ nt “; // true
[[],[]] == true; // true

-Not following proper naming convention, the following example does not give a descriptive naming, 
and is therefor hard for other people to understand.
ex. 
var Sara = ‘1001’;
function Mona() {
}
